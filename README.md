# SHA-256

A simple implementation of the sha-256 in c++

**Note:** While checking for the correctness of the hash using a file, make sure there is no extra line at the end of the file, (or if it is there, make sure to take into account the extra line while calculating the hash) a new line is appended in the file, so that has to be taken into account
